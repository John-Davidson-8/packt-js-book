/*  change the value of the variable to another company property so we access another property */

/* update the value of accessed property with var1 and print to console */

/* modify the the value of the postcode property inside the address object , which in turn is inside the company object. There are two ways to do this */

/* Now change the street value inside the address object. Use the other way to do this (hint: remember square brackets) */
